#Class: BalancedSort
#Version: v0.1
#Purpose: The balanced sort creates teams by trying to have the total
#         earning bonus of the entire team close to everyother team.
#         A design choice that must be made is if there should be a
#         maximum EB per player, and any EB above that number is temporarilly
#         reduced down to this ceiling. The logic behind it is that
#         a higher EB does not strictly mean a better performance
#         as it depends on the research that the player is able to obtain.
#Changelog:
# v0.1 - Create stub class.
