#Class: SimpleSort
#Version: v0.1
#Purpose: This sort creates teams by distributing players to each team by
#         sorting the strongest players first, all the way down to the
#         weakest players.
#         This has the unintended effect of the earlier ranking teams of
#         being stringer than their later counterparts.
#Changelog:
# v0.1 - Create stub class.
